# Simple-php-calculator
Simple calculator - created with HTML, PHP and CSS  and made to look like a real calculator, with buttons, 2-display,etc. (No JS)

I noticed that most calculator created with PHP doesn't actually look and behave like a really calculator and I challenged myself to create something that will, I hoped 
to find something simple to just recreate, after doing my research, I was shocked that I couldn't find any one with just html and php, most of them were create 
with js, jqueryy, Ajax, and I wanted it to be purely PHP and at most HTML to create the form. 

 - How does a regular PHP calculator look like?
 1. A form field  to input data 1
 2. A form selection to choose the operation "+,-,/,*
 3. Another form field to input data 2
 4. Displayed answer after data is submitted
 5. Limited to have one calculation at a time
 
 That is actually the basic of a calculator, but I wanted something that actually looked and feel like a calculator
 
 How does a real calculator feel and look like? (The Goal)
 1. Data input by buttons
 2. Display that shows all the data together
 2. Display the shows the data as they are typed/clicked
 3. Actual looks of a calculator
 4. Freedom to input as much mathematical calculation expression, eg, " 5*5+8-8/2 "

Gladly all of my goal for the project was achieved and more, here are other goals that I was able to acheive
1. Actual calculator look and feel
2. Convert inputs from string to mathematical expression and output the answer
3. Saves the question from display and shows it again white the answer below (2-display calculator)
4. Write code to display error for various input that are natural not mathematical express, such as empty fields, syntax error, input error, etc
5. Limit output to 12 characters
6. And so much more that a simple calculator has

There are however something(s) I wish I could achieve
1. Limit data input to 13 characters when inputting data by buttons (The limitation works when you input data by typing in the actual form - The top part of the display is
an actual form field.

What do you think?
